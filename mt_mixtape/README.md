## MT Mixtape: What Does This Workflow Do?

**MT Mixtape** is a plug-and-play n8n workflow that automates the process of:

- Collecting music artist and song suggestions from your team via Telegram
- Enriching submissions with AI (artist bios, genres, key songs)
- Managing a collaborative artist database in Notion
- Adding songs directly to a shared Spotify playlist
- Running a weekly artist selection and review cycle
- Gathering ratings and stats, and sharing them back to the group

**Who is it for?**
- Teams, clubs, or friend groups who want a fun, low-effort way to discover new music together
- Operators who want to automate group curation and reduce manual admin
- Anyone who wants to combine AI, Notion, Telegram, and Spotify in a seamless workflow

**Problems Solved:**
- No more scattered music suggestions â€” everything is tracked, enriched, and organized
- No manual copy-paste between chat, Notion, and Spotify
- Everyone participates, votes, and rates, with zero admin overhead
- Stats and progress are always visible

## How It Works (Walkthrough)

### 1. Suggest an Artist or Song
- Team members send `/artist [name]` or `/song [title]` in the Telegram group.
- The workflow extracts the artist/song, cleans up the input, and enriches it with AI (bio, genres, key songs).
- If it's a song, itâ€™s added to the shared Spotify playlist. Optionally, the artist can be added to the Notion DB.

### 2. Queue Management
- Each new artist is checked for duplicates in Notion.
- If new, itâ€™s added to the "Queue" with all AI-enriched info and submitter details.
- If already exists, the bot notifies the user.

### 3. Weekly Artist Selection
- On `/next`, the bot picks the next queued artist and posts their info in Telegram.
- The group can approve or shuffle for a new pick.
- Once approved, the artist status is set to "Current".

### 4. Review and Rating
- After a week, `/done` triggers a rating form in Telegram.
- Ratings are stored in Notion, and the artist is marked as "Completed".
- The bot prompts the group to pick the next artist.

### 5. Stats and Progress
- `/stats` command shares:
  - Total artists
  - Weeks completed
  - Average rating
  - Most explored genres
  - Highest-rated artists
  - Link to the full Notion artist list

- **Restrict Access**: Use the Filter node to limit who can submit commands.
- **AI Model**: Swap GPT-4 for another model if desired.
- **Notifications**: Add more Telegram messages for reminders or milestones.

## Limitations

- Requires all integrations to be set up and connected (Telegram, Notion, Spotify, OpenAI)
- AI may occasionally misinterpret ambiguous submissions
- Notion DB schema must match workflow expectations
- Designed for small/medium groups (not public bots)
